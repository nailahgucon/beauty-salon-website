Kept reset JQuery button and added validation for password and username.
'Password' and 'Confirm Password' has to have similar values or else a prompt will appear to warn the user.
'Úsername' must be unique, hence a user's input for username will be checked against the database table 'userdetails' rows to check for duplicate usernames. if duplicate username is found, a prompt will appear to warn the user.
